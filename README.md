# NlpMovieDb

## Synopsis
The project is semantic search engine on movie database using Natural Language Processing and Information retrieval techniques
The user provides a search query to the search engine and it returns a movie list with scores.
Here is how it is different from conventional search engines.  
1. It is based on semantic search and not keywords based approach which is how popular search engines implementation in IMDB, rotten tomatoes works.  
2. Information of the complete plot is parsed to form a graph model, representing the series of events, characters and their properties.


## Existing Problem & Motivation
Based on web mining and analysis from the websites like Movies.stackexchange, IMDB, Quora and others, we observed that more
than 90% of the questions posted online go unanswered. Clearly the magnitude of this problem is big, which got us motivated
towards this project and to successful answer these questions.
